This repo contains the Point feature tracking and object tracking
1) point feature tracking - Point feature tracking is a computer vision technique used to track specific points of interest across multiple images or video frames. In Python CV projects, libraries like OpenCV can be employed to extract key points and track their motion using algorithms like Lucas-Kanade or KLT. Inliers are successfully tracked points, outliers fail to match, and bipolar points exhibit both behaviors. This approach enables applications like object tracking, motion estimation, video stabilization, and augmented reality, while techniques such as RANSAC handle outliers to ensure accurate and robust tracking results.
2) object tracker_depthai - The object tracker_depth AI_spatial project is a computer vision application developed in Python using OpenCV. It combines object tracking techniques with depth estimation using spatial AI algorithms to track objects in a video stream and estimate their distance from the camera. By leveraging trained computer vision models, the project enables real-time object tracking and provides valuable spatial information for various applications, such as augmented reality and autonomous navigation.
